        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Passionate about technology and driven by a thirst for knowledge, I am currently pursuing B.Tech with a specialization in Data Science. 
            I am constantly exploring new technologies, refining my programming skills, and seeking opportunities to grow.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe in the power of collaboration and knowledge-sharingâ€”engaging in discussions, exchanging ideas, and learning from diverse perspectives.
            Growth happens best when we learn together.
            Beyond tech, I enjoy expanding my knowledge across various domains, always curious to explore something new.

                    </h3>
                    <p> Along with my team, I developed a Smart Mess Management System to streamline mess operations, including meal booking, billing, and attendance tracking. 
                        The system uses real-time data to improve efficiency and user experience, allowing users to easily manage their meal preferences and payments. This project enhanced our skills in system design, problem-solving, and database management.

                    <h3>Digital Website for Daily Wage Workers</h3>
                    <p>Together with my team, I developed a digital platform designed to help daily wage workers find job opportunities and manage their work schedules.
                     The website connects workers with potential employers, providing a user-friendly interface for posting jobs, applying for positions, and tracking work hours. 
                     This project aimed to empower workers by offering a simple, accessible tool for improving their employment prospects, while also enhancing our skills in web development and user experience design.

                    <p> 
                        I developed a comprehensive digital portfolio using HTML and CSS to effectively showcase my academic, extracurricular, and professional achievements. This project involved designing a clean, user-friendly interface with a focus on visual appeal and easy navigation.
                        By leveraging HTML for structure and CSS for styling, I was able to create a professional, well-organized platform that highlights my skills and experiences, while also strengthening my web development abilities.
